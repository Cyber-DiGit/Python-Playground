# Python Playground & Learning Journal

Welcome to my digital workshop! This repository is where I'm forging my path from fundamentals to production-ready code. It serves as a live, public record of my progress, my experiments, and my solutions to various coding challenges as I journey through computer science.

The code here isn't always perfect, but it's always a step forward.

## üéØ Current Focus (As of [July, 2025])

Right now, my primary focus is on building a rock-solid foundation in:

*   **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Implementing and understanding core data structures from scratch in Python.
*   **Problem Solving:** Consistently working through challenges on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank to improve my logical reasoning.
*   **Pythonic Code:** Learning to write clean, efficient, and readable Python that follows best practices.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

To keep things organized, this repository follows a clear structure. Here's how to navigate my work:

*   **/dsa:** Contains my implementations of various Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Trees, etc.) and solutions to classic algorithm problems.
*   **/projects:** Larger, multi-file projects. This is where I'll build small applications to practice real-world development skills.
*   **/cs50:** Solutions and notes from Harvard's CS50 course, which kicked off this entire journey.
*   **/snippets-and-scripts:** A collection of small, single-file scripts and useful code snippets for various tasks.

## üó∫Ô∏è My Roadmap

This repository is a reflection of my long-term goals. My plan is structured in phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundations (Current):** Master DSA, core CS concepts, and become fluent in Python.
2.  **Phase 2: Specialization:** Go deep into one area of interest, such as **Web Development (Flask/Django)** or **AI/Machine Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)**.
3.  **Phase 3: Portfolio Building:** Develop a full-stack, meaningful project that solves a real-world problem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technology

*   **Language:** Python 3.3
*   **Development Environment:** GitHub Codespaces
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
